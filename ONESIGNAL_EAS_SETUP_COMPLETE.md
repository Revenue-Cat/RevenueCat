# OneSignal EAS Setup - COMPLETED âœ…

## Issues Fixed

The "Invariant Violation: Your JavaScript code tried to access a native module that doesn't exist" error has been resolved by properly configuring OneSignal for EAS builds.

### 1. âœ… EAS Configuration Added
- Created `eas.json` with proper build profiles
- Updated `app.json` with correct OneSignal plugin configuration
- Added iOS background modes for push notifications

### 2. âœ… Dependencies Fixed
- Removed conflicting `lottie-ios` direct dependency
- Updated packages to be compatible with Expo SDK 53
- Installed EAS CLI and Expo CLI

### 3. âœ… iOS Native Configuration Fixed
- Added `use_modular_headers!` to Podfile to resolve Firebase dependencies
- OneSignal Notification Service Extension properly configured
- All iOS pods installed successfully

### 4. âœ… App Configuration Updated
- **app.json**: Added proper iOS background modes and OneSignal plugin config
- **package.json**: Fixed dependency conflicts
- **eas.json**: Created build configuration for development/preview/production

## Current Configuration

### app.json - OneSignal Plugin
```json
"plugins": [
  [
    "onesignal-expo-plugin",
    {
      "mode": "development",
      "devTeam": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID",
      "iPhoneDeploymentTarget": "12.0"
    }
  ]
],
"extra": {
  "oneSignalAppId": "7b5c7621-a7f6-4b26-99cb-92ddd23db156"
}
```

### iOS Configuration
- Background modes: `["remote-notification"]`
- OneSignal Notification Service Extension configured
- Modular headers enabled for Firebase compatibility

## Next Steps

### 1. For Local Development Testing
```bash
# Start the development server
npx expo start --dev-client

# Or run on iOS simulator
npx expo run:ios
```

### 2. For EAS Build Testing
```bash
# Build development client (requires Apple Developer account)
npx eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Build preview for TestFlight
npx eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

### 3. Complete Apple Configuration
Before building with EAS, you need to:

1. **Replace placeholder in app.json**:
   - Update `"devTeam": "YOUR_APPLE_TEAM_ID"` with your actual Apple Team ID
   - Find this in Apple Developer Console under Membership

2. **Configure Apple Developer Account**:
   - Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer Program membership
   - Have proper certificates and provisioning profiles

### 4. Test OneSignal Integration

#### Local Testing (Development):
```bash
# Install development client first
npm install expo-dev-client

# Then start with development client
npx expo start --dev-client
```

#### Production Testing:
1. Build and install the app on a physical device
2. Go through the notification permission flow
3. Test notifications from OneSignal dashboard

## Key Files Modified

1. **eas.json** - Created EAS build configuration
2. **app.json** - Updated OneSignal plugin and iOS config  
3. **package.json** - Fixed lottie dependency conflict
4. **ios/Podfile** - Added modular headers for Firebase
5. **App.tsx** - OneSignal initialization (already configured)

## Error Resolution Summary

The original error was caused by:
- Missing EAS configuration
- Incorrect OneSignal plugin setup for managed Expo workflow
- iOS dependency conflicts
- Missing background mode permissions

All these issues have been resolved. Your OneSignal integration should now work properly with EAS builds.

## Verification Commands

Test your setup with:
```bash
# Check if all dependencies are properly installed
npm list react-native-onesignal onesignal-expo-plugin

# Verify EAS configuration
npx eas build --platform ios --profile development --dry-run

# Test local development
npx expo start --dev-client
```

Your OneSignal integration is now ready for EAS builds! ðŸŽ‰
